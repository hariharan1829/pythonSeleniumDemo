# âœ… What are fixtures in pytest?
import pytest

# Fixtures in pytest are used to set up and tear down test environments automatically.
# They help in initializing test data, configurations, or resources before a test runs,
# and cleaning them up after the test completes.

# ðŸ”¹ Advantages of using fixtures:
# 1. Reusability â€“ The same fixture can be used across multiple tests.
# 2. Automatic setup and teardown â€“ Code before `yield` runs before the test,
#    and code after `yield` runs after the test.
# 3. Scope control â€“ You can define how often a fixture runs (per test, per class, per module, per session).
# 4. Dependency injection â€“ Fixtures can be passed as arguments to test functions automatically.

# Tag used to define a fixture: @pytest.fixture
#Tag used : @pytest.fixture
